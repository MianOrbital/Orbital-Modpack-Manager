Version 0.0.1 - WOOT!

This is a silly little project to learn about http clients and some other language stuff

If you are trying to use this without knowning "MastersChief"... this probably isnt something you want to do.

To install:
Just download the .exe in the files above

There is like a 95% chance this doesn't actually work...
it is also just an installer and a janky one at that...
in the three partial tests I did:
test 1 had no unicode
test 2 crashed on launch
test 3 had major memory leaks
I changed nothing between these tests and did nothing that should impact that.


Todo
-more global vars
--user dir config
-json saftey
-CLI
-Kiss my wife goodnight
-check imports, OS to paths/file when able
